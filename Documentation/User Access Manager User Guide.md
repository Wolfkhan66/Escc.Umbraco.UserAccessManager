## User permissions

Displays the current content tree, showing the permissions assigned to the selected user.

Each level of content tree is retrieved when its parent is expanded, hence the icon may change from a document to a folder if there are sub-nodes.

Ticking and clearing the checkbox against each page updates the permissions immediately.

## Copy user permissions

Replace permissions for the current user with those from another user.
